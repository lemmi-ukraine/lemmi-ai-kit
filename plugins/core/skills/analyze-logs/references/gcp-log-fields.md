# GCP Structured Log Fields — Worked Example

**One platform's spelling of the field roles, not a requirement.** The skill's method is
platform-neutral: SKILL.md Step 1a maps the roles the analysis needs (timestamp, severity, message,
service identity, correlation id, latency, event name) onto whatever your platform calls them. This
file fills that table in for a GCP Cloud Logging export, because a concrete example is easier to
translate from than an abstract one. On CloudWatch, Loki, ELK, Datadog or journald, read the
**Analysis Use** column, find your platform's equivalent, and continue — nothing downstream depends
on these names.

## Primary Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Analysis Use |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| `severity` | string | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `ALERT`, `EMERGENCY` | Issue identification, priority sorting |
| `timestamp` | string | RFC 3339 timestamp | Timeline reconstruction, correlation |
| `textPayload` | string | Unstructured log message (plain text) | Error messages, stack traces |
| `jsonPayload` | object | Structured log data | Parsed error details, context fields |
| `jsonPayload.message` | string | Log message within structured payload | Primary error text |
| `jsonPayload.severity` | string | Application-level severity (may differ from top-level) | Cross-reference with top-level severity |
| `insertId` | string | Unique entry ID | Deduplication |
| `trace` | string | `projects/{project}/traces/{trace_id}` | Request correlation across entries |
| `spanId` | string | Span within a trace | Sub-operation correlation |
| `resource` | object | Source resource metadata | Service identification |

## Resource Labels

These carry the *service identity* role — the field you group by when one file holds several
emitters.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `resource.type` | e.g., `cloud_run_revision`, `k8s_container` |
| `resource.labels.service_name` | Cloud Run service name |
| `resource.labels.revision_name` | Deployment revision |
| `resource.labels.location` | GCP region |
| `resource.labels.project_id` | GCP project ID |
| `resource.labels.configuration_name` | Service configuration |

## HTTP Request Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `httpRequest.requestMethod` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. |
| `httpRequest.requestUrl` | Full request URL |
| `httpRequest.status` | HTTP response status code |
| `httpRequest.latency` | Request duration (e.g., `0.234s`) |
| `httpRequest.userAgent` | Client user agent |
| `httpRequest.remoteIp` | Client IP |
| `httpRequest.responseSize` | Response body size in bytes |

## Application Context Fields (project-specific)

These appear in `jsonPayload` when set via the app's logging-context helper (e.g., `set_logging_context()`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user_id` | Authenticated user ID |
| `session_id` | WebSocket/HTTP session ID |
| `<feature>_id` | Feature-scoped session ID (features add their own, e.g., a domain-specific session identifier) |
| `request_id` | X-Request-ID header value |
| `event_type` | Application event classifier (from `log_event()`) |

## Parsing Tips

The first three generalize to any platform; the last two are GCP-specific string formats.

- **Stack traces** are typically in `textPayload` or `jsonPayload.message` as multi-line strings.
- **Python tracebacks** start with `Traceback (most recent call last):` and end with the exception line.
- **Multiple payloads**: an entry has EITHER `textPayload` OR `jsonPayload`, never both.
- **Trace correlation**: strip the `projects/{project}/traces/` prefix to get the raw trace ID for grouping.
- **Latency parsing**: `httpRequest.latency` is a string like `"0.234s"` — parse the float for comparison.
