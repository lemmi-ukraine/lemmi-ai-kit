# Project Learnings

This file is a **lean intake buffer**, not a knowledge store. New lessons are appended here by the
`task-learnings` skill, then **periodically drained** to the agent-facing home where each lesson is
actually useful — so this file normally holds only a handful of not-yet-promoted entries.

**Where the knowledge lives (consult these, not one big flat file):**
- **Universal conventions & anti-patterns** → `AGENTS.md` (always loaded).
- **Cross-cutting patterns** → the relevant `.claude/skills/*` skill.
- **Subsystem conventions & gotchas** → the code-adjacent **module / feature `README.md`**.
  **When you work in a subsystem, consult that subsystem's README** — that is where its
  promoted lessons live.
- **Invariant-guarding gotchas** → a co-located code comment at the exact site it guards.

**How entries are added:** `task-learnings` appends each finding as a `### [YYYY-MM-DD] title` block
under the matching `## Category` header (create the header if absent; use a canonical category —
Architecture Decisions, Common Pitfalls, External Service Quirks, Performance Insights, Pattern
Discoveries, Convention Clarifications). Place each entry under its **topic** category, never at the
file end (a chronological catch-all misleads the consolidator's clustering).

**How it drains:** periodically (`/learning-consolidator`, ~weekly) each accumulated entry is routed
to its home above and removed here.
